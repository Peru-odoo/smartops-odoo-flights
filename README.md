# Flights Odoo modules

Manage flight related records (private, operator or airline) in Odoo.

Initial models were generated by AI under the following query.

Ok, my magic assistant. We need to make draft source code to describe models for two Odoo Modules. Module `flights` is a base module and `flights_pilot` is a second module that extends features of the base module.

Idea of the module is to make an open source solution to manage different type of flight records about private aircraft flight, airline flight and operator center.


Please write python files according to the best Odoo standarts. Use the following copywrite notice for the files:

The models scheme is below.

MODULE 1. `flights`

```

`flight.airport`
     code = fields.Char()
     partner_id = fields.Char("Address")

`flight.aircraft`
     registration = fields.Char("Registration number")

`flight.number`
     airline_id = fields.Many2one('flight.airline')
     prefix = fields.Char()
     numbers = fields.Char()

`flight.airline`
     name = fields.Char()
     default_prefix = fields.Char(help="Default prefix assigned on creating a new flight.number for this airline")


`flight.crew`
     partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner')
     role_id = fields.Many2one(`flight.crew.role`)

`flight.crew.role`
     code = fields.Char()
     description = fields.Char()


`flight.flight`
     aircraft_id = 'flight.aircraft`
     flight_number_id = fields.Many2one('flight.number')
     crew_ids = fields.One2many('flight.crew')

     departure_id = fields.Many2one('flight.airport')
     event_ids = fields.One2many('flight.event')
     arrival_id = fields.Many2one('flight.airport')

`flight.event`
     event_type = fields.Many2one(`flight.event.type`)
     actual_date = fields.Datetime()
     estimated_date = fields.Datetime()
     scheduled_date = fields.Datetime()
     target_date = fields.Datetime()

`flight.event.type`
     code = fields.Char()
     description = fields.Char()

```

MODULE 2. `flights_pilotlog` â€” tool to extract and analyse records from legacy pilot log files.

```

Extended models:

`flight.aircraft`
    make_id = fields.Many2one("flight.aircraft.make")
    model_id = fields.Many2one("flight.aircraft.model")

`flight.flight`
    period_ids = fields.One2many("flight.period")


Additional models:

`flight.aircraft.make`
    name = fields.Char()

`flight.aircraft.model`
    name = fields.Char()

`flight.period`
    period_type_id = fields.Many2one('flight.period.type')
    duration = fields.Integer(help="Duration in minutes")
    # TODO: check if we need more fields here

`flight.period.type`
    code = fields.Char()

```
